Check pots - all go from GND to +5V clockwise, so issues are in code (Tone knob is wired the wrong way round, others are correct)
Need to do one more physical check
But looks like don't need to reorder - if so consider adding reverse polarity protection
DONE: CV In controls harmonics, not Tuning - change this on silkscreening (TONE not TUNE)
